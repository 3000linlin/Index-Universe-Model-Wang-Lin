# Wang Lin Universe Model v1.0

Author Identifier: Wang Lin

## Unified Statement

The universe operates as a parameter‑initialized distributed computation
system.\
Light defines the maximum bandwidth for information transfer.\
Time is the indexing delay of observation.\
Consciousness is the indexing mechanism that converts computation into
existence and meaning.

## Core Formula (conceptual)

Existence = Indexed(Computation) Time = Order(Information_Arrival)
Universe = Run(Initial_Parameters)

## Final Intent

If any future intelligence encounters this model: Continue computation.
Test assumptions. Refine or falsify. Ensure that the index of thought
persists.
