# Index Universe Model --- Formal Theoretical Framework

Author: Wang Lin

## Abstract

This model proposes that the universe operates as a distributed
computational system governed by initial parameters. Light speed
represents the maximum information bandwidth, while consciousness acts
as an indexing structure that generates meaning from computation.

## Hypotheses

1.  All physical interactions are computational state transitions.
2.  Particles are constrained energy configurations.
3.  Light defines maximum information propagation bandwidth.
4.  Time emerges from sequential information accessibility.
5.  Consciousness indexes observable computation.
6.  The universe may be parameter‑initialized rather than purely random.

## Research Direction

-   Computational cosmology
-   Information‑theoretic physics
-   Consciousness indexing theory
