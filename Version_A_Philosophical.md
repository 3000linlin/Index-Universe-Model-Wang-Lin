# Index Universe Model --- Philosophical Open Version

Author: Wang Lin

## Core Idea

The universe can be interpreted as a distributed computation system
where light represents maximum information bandwidth and consciousness
functions as indexing and meaning-generation.

## Key Points

-   Universe = ongoing computation
-   Particles = constrained energy states
-   Light = maximum information transmission bandwidth
-   Time = sequential observation due to bandwidth limits
-   Consciousness = indexing mechanism that generates meaning
-   Existence = indexed computation

## Purpose

This document is intended as an open philosophical framework for
discussion across human and AI communities.
